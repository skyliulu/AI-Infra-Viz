# AI-Infra-Viz 🚀

> **Lift the hood on large model inference and intuitively understand the low-level art of AI infrastructure.**

`AI-Infra-Viz` is an interactive, panoramic visualization project designed to bridge the cognitive gap between "abstract algorithms" and "low-level operators".
It shows not only how LLMs think, but also how the hardware Memory Wall is shattered by techniques like Flash Attention.

### 🌟 Highlights
- **LLM End-to-End Inference**: Watch MoE routing, RoPE positional encoding, and the autoregressive loop in real time.
- **Flash Attention Deep Dive**: Physics-level simulation of data movement and tiling strategies between SRAM and HBM.
- **Zero-Dependency Components**: All visualization logic is encapsulated in standalone React components, ready to reuse.
